MVP:
  extension only turns on youtube.com/watch.... (but for now this test page is youtube)
  extensions looks for these special characters:
    !$$^&%$$$LOVE{ [user_id_or_public_key] <= don't know what this is? lovebutton.com }EVOL$$
  replace this with an \<a> tag styled as a button that links to the donation page for this creator
    basic: on web page, do all donation logic (user chrome storage, worry about security later)
    advanced: new web page pops open and closed quickly and triggers the chrome extension in tab with youtube, donation logic happens there
    send transaction info to server to process transaction
    
  use stellar as currency first

    !$$^&%$LOVE{ [user_id_or_public_key] &lt= don't know what this is? https://love-button.glitch.me/about }EVOL$$
